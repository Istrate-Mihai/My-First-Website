          <p>
            Charles Babbage, (born December 26, 1791, London, England—died
            October 18, 1871, London), English mathematician and inventor who is
            credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1812 Babbage helped found the Analytical Society, whose object
            was to introduce developments from the European continent into
            English mathematics. In 1816 he was elected a fellow of the Royal
            Society of London. He was instrumental in founding the Royal
            Astronomical (1820) and Statistical (1834) societies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea of mechanically calculating mathematical tables first came
            to Babbage in 1812 or 1813. Later he made a small calculator that
            could perform certain mathematical computations to eight decimals.
            Then in 1823 he obtained government support for the design of a
            projected machine, the Difference Engine, with a 20-decimal
            capacity. Its construction required the development of mechanical
            engineering techniques, to which Babbage of necessity devoted
            himself. In the meantime (1828–39), he served as Lucasian Professor
            of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the mid-1830s Babbage developed plans for the Analytical
            Engine, the forerunner of the modern digital computer. In that
            device he envisioned the capability of performing any arithmetical
            operation on the basis of instructions from punched cards, a memory
            unit in which to store numbers, sequential control, and most of the
            other basic elements of the present-day computer. In 1843 Babbage’s
            friend mathematician Ada Lovelace translated a French paper about
            the Analytical Engine and, in her own annotations, published how it
            could perform a sequence of calculations, the first computer
            program. The Analytical Engine, however, was never completed.
            Babbage’s design was forgotten until his unpublished notebooks were
            discovered in 1937. In 1991 British scientists built Difference
            Engine No. 2—accurate to 31 digits—to Babbage’s specifications, and
            in 2000 the printer for the Difference Engine was also built.
          </p>
          <p>
            Babbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street,
            Marylebone, where he died, at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871; he
            was buried in London's Kensal Green Cemetery. According to Horsley,
            Babbage died "of renal inadequacy, secondary to cystitis."[179] He
            had declined both a knighthood and baronetcy. He also argued against
            hereditary peerages, favouring life peerages instead.

          <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
          <img

            alt="Ada Lovelace Portrait"

          />
          <p>
            The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess
            of Lovelace — better known as "Ada Lovelace" — showed her gift for
            mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an
            invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because
            she introduced many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the
            first computer programmer. She died on November 27, 1852.
          </p>
          <p>
            From early on, Lovelace showed a talent for numbers and language.
            She received instruction from William Frend, a social reformer;
            William King, the family's doctor; and Mary Somerville, a Scottish
            astronomer and mathematician. Somerville was one of the first women
            to be admitted into the Royal Astronomical Society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and
            inventor. The pair became friends, and the much older Babbage served
            as a mentor to Lovelace. Through Babbage, Lovelace began studying
            advanced mathematics with University of London professor Augustus de
            Morgan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lovelace was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's
            analytical engine that had been written by Italian engineer Luigi
            Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only translated the
            original French text into English but also added her own thoughts
            and ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up being three times
            longer than the original article. Her work was published in 1843, in
            an English science journal. Lovelace used only the initials
            "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the publication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lovelace's article attracted little attention when she was alive. In
            her later years, she tried to develop mathematical schemes for
            winning at gambling. Unfortunately, her schemes failed and put her
            in financial peril. Lovelace died from uterine cancer in London on
            November 27, 1852. She was buried next to her father, in the
            graveyard of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Nottingham,
            England.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852,[47] from uterine
            cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians.[48]
            The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took
            command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and
            confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a religious
            transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct
            and making Annabella her executor.[49] She lost contact with her
            husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused
            him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.[50]
            She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of
            St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque,
            written in Latin, to her and her father is in the chapel attached to
            Horsley Towers.

          Wilhelm Schickard, a German polymath, designed a calculating machine
          in 1623 which combined a mechanised form of Napier's rods with the
          world's first mechanical adding machine built into the base. Because
          it made use of a single-tooth gear there were circumstances in which
          its carry mechanism would jam.[16] A fire destroyed at least one of
          the machines in 1624 and it is believed Schickard was too disheartened
          to build another.

          1801: In France, weaver and merchant Joseph Marie Jacquard creates a
          loom that uses wooden punch cards to automate the design of woven
          fabrics. Early computers would use similar punch cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          1890: Inventor Herman Hollerith designs the punch card system to
          calculate the 1880 U.S. census. It took him three years to create, and
          it saved the government $5 million. He would eventually go on to
          establish a company that would become IBM.
