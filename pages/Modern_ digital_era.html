    <h1>The modern landscape of IT</h1>
    <h2>The integrated circuit</h2>
    <p>
      The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the
      integrated circuit (IC). The idea of the integrated circuit was first
      conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment
      of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the
      first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on
      Progress in Quality Electronic Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May
      1952.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first working ICs were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and
      Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor.Kilby recorded his initial ideas
      concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating
      the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.In his patent
      application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as "a body
      of semiconductor material ... wherein all the components of the electronic
      circuit are completely integrated".However, Kilby's invention was a hybrid
      integrated circuit (hybrid IC), rather than a monolithic integrated
      circuit (IC) chip.Kilby's IC had external wire connections, which made it
      difficult to mass-produce.

      Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs
      in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in
      large and powerful machines such as supercomputers, mainframe computers
      and servers. Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single
      integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely
      available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that
      differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from
      general purpose computers.They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized
      high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs
      tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of
      program organization required to successfully utilize most of the
      available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in
      large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography applications,
      as well as with other so-called "embarrassingly parallel" tasks.

    <h2>Moble Devices</h2>
    <p>
      The first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power. The 50lb
      IBM 5100 was an early example. Later portables such as the Osborne 1 and
      Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged
      in. The first laptops, such as the Grid Compass, removed this requirement
      by incorporating batteries â€“ and with the continued miniaturization of
      computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable
      computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.The same developments allowed
      manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones
      by the early 2000s.
    </p>
    <p>
      hese smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and
      recently became the dominant computing device on the market.These are
      powered by System on a Chip (SoCs), which are complete computers on a
      microchip the size of a coin.

    <h2>About Ethical Hacking</h2>
    <p>
      Hacking significantly affects the development of systems and networks.
      This is especially the case of systems and networks of organizations where
      sensitive or confidential information are used on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organizations must find solutions and measures to protect information
      technology assets. In this endeavor, organizations can use ethical
      hacking. Ethical hacking is a hacking role that business organizations can
      exploit for security purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethical hacking presents advantages to increase the capabilities of
      organizations to protect their IT and information assets. Ethical hacking
      sheds a positive light on hacking. Nonetheless, any organization that
      implements ethical hacking must consider the potential negative impacts
      and issues arising from the practice.
