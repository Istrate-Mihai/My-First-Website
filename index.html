        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The computer was born not for entertainment or email<br />
          but out of a need to solve a serious number-crunching crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1880, the U.S. population had grown so large that<br />
          it took more than seven years to tabulate the U.S. Census results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government sought a faster way to get the job done,<br />
          giving rise to punch-card based computers that took up entire rooms.

        <h2>Definition of a Modern Computer</h2>
        <p>
          A computer is a machine or device that performs processes, <br />
          calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a
          software <br />
          or hardware program. It has the ability to accept data (input),
          process it, and then produce outputs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Computers can also store data for later uses in appropriate storage
          devices, and retrieve whenever it is necessary.<br />
          Modern computers are electronic devices used for a variety of purposes
          ranging from browsing the web,<br />
          writing documents, editing videos,<br />
          creating applications, playing video games, etc.<br />
          They are designed to execute applications and provide a variety of
          solutions by combining integrated<br />
          hardware and software components.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The earliest digital electronic device that could be defined as the
          first modern computer is the Colossus. Built in 1943-44, <br />
          the Colossus was devised to crack the Lorenz SZ 40/42, a German
          encryption machine used to support military communications during
          World War II.<br />
          Modern computers come in all shapes and sizes to perform a broad range
          of different functions.<br />
          Although the first ones that come to mind are desktop and laptop
          computers, many other less-assuming devices,<br />
          such as grocery scanners, ATMs, and smart TVs â€” are computers as well.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Today, we carry more computing power on our smartphones than was
          available in these early models. The following brief history of
          computing is a timeline of how <br />
          computers evolved from their humble beginnings to the machines of
          today that surf the Internet, play games and stream multimedia in
          addition to crunching numbers.
